/**
 * The check every write arriving FROM A CLIENT passes before it runs — the write-side twin of
 * {@code ClientQueryGuard}.
 *
 * <h3>What it stops</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The application's row rules</b> ({@link WritePolicy}) — for what a column list cannot express, such as
 *       a column that may be written on some rows but not others. Judged on the parsed write, after the list.</li>
 *   <li><b>The columns in {@link ClientWriteDenyList}</b> — password hashes, sign-in usernames, the account's
 *       disabled flag — however a DQL statement sets them. Enforced by an {@link Inspector} a server module
 *       registers, because reading a statement properly needs the DQL parser, which this module cannot depend
 *       on.</li>
 *   <li><b>Raw statements.</b> A submit that is not DQL reaches the database as written, past every check that
 *       reads what a statement touches — including the one above, which a raw
 *       {@code update frontend_account set password=…} would otherwise simply walk round. Refused unless the
 *       application's {@link RawStatementPolicy} lists that exact statement: the React apps never send one, and
 *       the legacy clients send a couple of fixed ones an application can name.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It is NOT write authorisation: whose rows a client may change is a different question, answered by the
 * application's authorizer. This closes the narrower route from writing to signing in as somebody, which every
 * control on sessions and passwords depends on.
 *
 * <h3>Where it is called</h3>
 *
 * <p>From the two endpoints through which a client's writes arrive — single and batch — and nowhere else. Server
 * code calls the submit service directly and never passes through here, so the flows that must write these
 * columns (a password change, an email change) still can.
 *
 * <p>A transaction preamble with no statement is let through: the server supplies the real one.
 *
 * <p>Compiled into the browser too (the endpoints are registered in the GWT entry point), so it uses only the JRE
 * GWT emulates.
