/**
 * Reading revocations back, including the case that made the first version of this loop useless.
 *
 * <p><b>"Sign out everywhere" revokes every row in one statement</b>, so thousands of families carry the
 * same timestamp to the microsecond. A poll bounded only by time then reads the first page, advances its
 * watermark to that same timestamp, reaches back over it for safety, and reads the identical page again —
 * for ever, at one page a second, while the families past the page boundary are never refused on sight at
 * all. Silently, because every log line says it is working.
 *
 * <p>So the cases below walk a bulk revocation to its end, and then check the other half: that after
 * catching up the poll goes back to a WINDOW that overlaps what it already read, because a transaction
 * can commit late and surface a revocation timestamped behind the watermark. The two bounds cover
 * different failures and neither alone is enough.
 *
 * <p>The store here orders and pages exactly as the SQL does — ordered by (revoked, id), cursor strictly
 * after the last row of the previous page — so that the contract the interface states is exercised by
 * something other than the one implementation that must obey it.
 *
 * <p>No test framework, for the reason recorded in webfx-stack-authz-core. Run from main(); it exits
 * non-zero while the issue stands.
