/**
 * Tables and columns a CLIENT's query may never touch, whatever it selects, filters or joins on.
 *
 * <h3>Why names at the SQL level</h3>
 *
 * <p>Matched against the table and column names the query compiler actually emits, not against the words in
 * the query. A DQL statement can reach a column without naming its table — {@code person.frontendAccount.password}
 * reads a password from a query rooted at {@code Document} — and can touch one without selecting it, in a
 * {@code where} clause that lets a client test guesses one row at a time. What reaches SQL is the only thing
 * that cannot be rephrased, so that is what is checked. See the inspector that enforces this.
 *
 * <h3>What belongs here</h3>
 *
 * <p>Secrets whose disclosure is a way in, not merely a leak: sign-in tokens and codes, password hashes, reset
 * tokens. This is not the place for ordinary personal data, which needs a real read-authorisation model rather
 * than a list — a list long enough to cover it would be a policy nobody could review.
 *
 * <p>Plain collections and copy-on-write rather than concurrent ones, because this class is compiled into the
 * browser as well (the query endpoints that consult it are registered in the GWT entry point) and only the
 * JRE that GWT emulates is available. Entries are added at boot and read on every client query, which is the
 * access pattern copy-on-write suits anyway.

     * A column a client may TEST but never READ — the shape a capability token needs.
     *
     * <h3>Why a third category, and not simply a denial</h3>
     *
     * <p>A capability token is a secret the holder is supposed to present. An invitation link, a volunteer's
     * proposed dates, an arrival confirmation: the page is reached by whoever holds the link, and the server
     * finds the row by the token in it. So the column cannot be denied outright — the feature IS looking a row
     * up by it — and it cannot be left readable either, because <b>the way a capability like this is defeated is
     * not by guessing one but by asking for all of them.</b> {@code select token from Invitation} returns every
     * live token, and the tokens are random precisely so that nobody has to guess.
     *
     * <p>So: comparing it for equality against a bound parameter is allowed — as many times in one statement as
     * the caller likes, which is guessing at whatever rate the transport allows and is worth nothing against a
     * random token — and everything else is refused —
     * selecting it, ordering by it, testing it with {@code like} or a range, grouping on it. What that leaves a
     * caller is one bit per request, "does this exact token exist", which is what presenting a capability
     * legitimately tells you and is worth nothing against a random one.
     *
     * <p><b>The check is fail-closed on anything it does not recognise</b>, which is what makes a rule this
     * specific safe to state: a statement naming one of these columns in a construct the check cannot read is
     * refused rather than guessed at. The population of such statements is tiny and known, so a false refusal
     * shows up at once rather than lurking.

     *
     * <p>Pausing it also removed the only instrument. The refusal WAS the detection, so with the rule off
     * there is no way to tell whether the stale clients have gone, and switching it back on to find out costs
     * another round of broken invitations. That is a guess dressed as a date.
