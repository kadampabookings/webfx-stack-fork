/**
 * Compiled statements, kept per data scope and bounded in both directions.
 *
 * <p>Two dimensions, and they fail differently.
 *
 * <p><b>Statements.</b> The key is text a CLIENT chooses, so a caller minting variants grows this without
 * limit — the hazard the read inventory caps itself against in as many words. It was unbounded before scope
 * existed; scope only multiplies it. Capped by dropping the least recently used, which beats clearing in
 * exactly the case the cap exists for: a caller minting statements evicts entries either way, but the
 * application's own statements are used constantly and so survive, where clearing discards them alongside
 * the noise and recompiles everything at once.
 *
 * <p><b>Scope tokens.</b> Bounded only if a token names one of a fixed set of scopes. Hand it something
 * caller-derived — an organization-id set, say — and the cache grows combinatorially with the callers. That
 * is a mistake in our own code, never in traffic, so it REFUSES rather than evicting: a design error that
 * throws on the first few requests is cheaper than one found later in a heap dump. It cannot fire while no
 * scope provider is registered, because an unscoped compilation has no token at all.
 *
 * <p>Not weakly or softly referenced. Weak keys would be collected almost at once — the key is a string
 * built per request and held by nothing else — so the cache would simply stop caching. Soft references clear
 * in bulk under memory pressure, which means every query recompiles at the moment the server is least able
 * to afford it.
