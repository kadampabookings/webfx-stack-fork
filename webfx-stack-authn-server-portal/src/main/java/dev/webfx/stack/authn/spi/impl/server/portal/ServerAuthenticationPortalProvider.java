     * knows, and refuses them at renewal even if it never does, so a device stops at its next message.
     *
     * <p><b>The devices are now told at once, and the distinction matters.</b> An earlier version of this
     * did NOT push, because a push is addressed by run id while a revocation is scoped by family, and
     * those do not line up: tabs of one browser share a family but each holds its own run id, so pushing
     * to "every run id of this person except the caller's" would sign out the caller's OTHER TABS, whose
     * session was deliberately spared. That objection was answered by making the push family-aware rather
     * than by-person — the push server now records which family each connected client holds — so what is
     * told is exactly the set that was revoked, and the caller's spared family is not in it. See
     * RevokedFamilyLogoutPush.
     *
     * <p>Do not read that as a stronger guarantee than it is. The push is a courtesy to a cooperating
     * client; revoking is still the whole of the enforcement, and a device that ignores the message, or
     * is offline, or is connected to the other instance, stops at its next message as before.
