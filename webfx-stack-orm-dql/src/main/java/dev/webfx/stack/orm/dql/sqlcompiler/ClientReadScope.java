/**
 * The condition the server adds to a client's read of a given entity — data scope, the second mechanism of
 * the read-authorization plan.
 *
 * <p>Sits where {@code DenyingCompilerDomainModelReader} sits, and is total for the same reason: the compiler
 * creates one build per select, from a single place, so a rule attached to an entity applies wherever that
 * entity is selected — in a subquery, a CTE body, every branch of a union. A pass over the parsed statement
 * would be only as complete as its author's memory of the grammar.
 *
 * <p><b>The condition is an Expression, never SQL text.</b> Three things follow from that and none would
 * survive a string: it is compiled by the same compiler, so the denying reader still checks every name inside
 * it and a scope predicate cannot quietly read a denied column; its parameters bind through the ordinary path
 * rather than being spliced; and it stays portable across the DBMS syntaxes.
 *
 * <p><b>The token is opaque here.</b> DQL has no notion of a grant, so it is handed a value that identifies
 * WHICH scope applies and asks the provider what that means. That keeps the dependency pointing one way, and
 * it is what lets the compilation cache stay correct: compiled SQL is keyed by statement text, and with scope
 * injected the same text compiles differently per scope, so the token joins the key. It has to be a small
 * comparable value for that to be bounded — which is the argument for a fixed set of named scopes rather than
 * a predicate assembled per request, arriving here as a hard constraint rather than a preference.
