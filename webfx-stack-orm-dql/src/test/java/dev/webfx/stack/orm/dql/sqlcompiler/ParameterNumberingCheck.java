/**
 * That a statement's parameters land in one numbering rather than two overlapping ones.
 *
 * <p>Named parameters used to be numbered in a counter of their own starting at 1, so {@code ?caller}
 * beside {@code event=$1} compiled to {@code $1} as well and the two shared a placeholder. No client can
 * send both — a QueryArgument names all of its values or none — so the collision was unreachable until the
 * SERVER began adding terms to a client's statement, which is what read-authorization scope injection does.
 *
 * <p>The two cases worth keeping an eye on are the ones asserting NO change: pure positional and pure named
 * are what every statement in the system is today, and this exists as much to hold them still as to fix the
 * mixed case.
 *
 * <p>The subquery case is the one that would break first under a cheaper implementation. A maximum computed
 * by walking the outer clauses would miss a {@code $n} that only a subquery mentions, and would then hand a
 * named parameter a slot already in use. It is here because it is the case a rewrite would get wrong.
