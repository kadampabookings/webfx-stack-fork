/**
 * Which entities may not be written without the application's say-so, and who to ask.
 *
 * <p>Registry inversion, like {@code RestrictedPrincipalRegistry} and {@code AuditActorRegistry}: the
 * framework owns one enforcement point that a caller cannot route around, and the application owns the
 * policy. The alternative — teaching the DQL layer what an authorization is — would put a dependency on
 * the authz stack into the path every write takes, to express a rule only the application knows.
 *
 * <p><b>The framework enforces the answer it is given and holds no policy of its own</b>, deliberately.
 * There is no "report only" switch here, because a leniency knob in the framework is a knob nobody can
 * see from the application that owns the rule: whether to deny or merely observe is part of the policy,
 * so it belongs with the authorizer, which can also explain itself in the log. What this class
 * guarantees is narrower and more useful — that the question is always asked.
 *
 * <p>With nothing registered, nothing is protected and every write proceeds exactly as before. That is
 * what lets this ship ahead of any policy.
