/**
 * Decides whether a statement uses a capability column the one way it may: tested for equality against a bound
 * parameter, in a WHERE, and nowhere else.
 *
 * <h3>Why a traversal here, when the denying reader exists precisely to avoid one</h3>
 *
 * <p>Because the two answer different questions. The reader is exhaustive and context-free: it sees every column
 * that reaches SQL and has no idea where in the statement it came from. That is exactly right for a secret, which
 * may not be reached at all. It cannot express "may be compared, may not be selected", because by the time the
 * compiler asks for a column name the difference is gone.
 *
 * <p>So the reader keeps finding these columns — it records them rather than refusing, and the inspector asks here
 * whether the finding was legitimate. This traversal supplies the context the reader cannot, and the reader
 * supplies the trigger this traversal cannot be trusted to find on its own.
 *
 * <h3>Fail-closed is what makes it sound</h3>
 *
 * <p>A traversal is only as complete as its author's memory of the grammar, which is the objection
 * {@code DenyingCompilerDomainModelReader} raises against traversals and it is a fair one. The answer is not to
 * claim completeness but to refuse without it: <b>every node this does not recognise is a refusal</b>, not a pass.
 * A construct nobody thought of therefore costs a refused query rather than a disclosed token.
 *
 * <p>That is affordable here and would not be on the general read path, because only statements that actually
 * reach a capability column are walked — three queries in the whole product today. A false refusal is one broken
 * page, seen immediately, on a path somebody is looking at.

     * <h3>The reader's count and this walk's must AGREE</h3>
     *
     * <p>This is asked only because the reader has already seen capability columns reach SQL, and it is told how
     * MANY. Every one of them has to be a sanctioned test this walk can point at; anything left over is a read
     * the walk could not see, and the reader is the one to believe, because it sees what the compiler emits
     * while this sees what the statement says.
     *
     * <p>They come apart for real reasons, all three of them live in this model: a fields group expands to its
     * member columns, a field can be defined as an expression, and a bare foreign key pulls in its target's
     * default fields. <b>A statement can therefore read a token without naming it.</b>
     *
     * <p>Requiring merely that the walk found SOMETHING was the first version's defect, and it failed OPEN in the
     * worst way available: one legitimate {@code token = $1} licensed every hidden read beside it, so
     * {@code select firstName,email,<arrival> from VolunteeringApplication where arrivalConfirmationToken=$1 or
     * id>0} returned every live token in the table. The count is what closes that, and it closes the class
     * rather than the three constructs — a fourth would be caught by the same invariant on the day it is added.
