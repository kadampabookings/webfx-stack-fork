     * logged out does nothing) and it is what keeps a connection reachable on a message that carried no
     * token. Null therefore means "never held a readable token", not "logged out".

     * a caller file its own genuine family under somebody else's runId and then sign that person out by
     * ending its own session. So the first session to claim a runId owns it, and a claim arriving from a
     * different session is refused — the refused client simply keeps finding out at its next message, which
     * is where it was before any of this existed.
