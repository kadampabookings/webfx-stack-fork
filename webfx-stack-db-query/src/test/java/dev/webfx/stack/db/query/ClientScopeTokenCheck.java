/**
 * That a data scope reaches the compiler, reaches only a client's own query, and never reaches the wire.
 *
 * <p>Three properties, each of which was a way to get this wrong.
 *
 * <p><b>A server read is not a client read.</b> The token is set at the three generic query endpoints and
 * nowhere else, so an endpoint's own lookup — which reaches the query service directly — compiles unscoped.
 * Deciding it from the thread's origin instead would have scoped those too, and the first casualty would have
 * been an authorization lookup reading through the filter it exists to check, which is not a check. The
 * negative case below is the one to keep: an argument built the way server code builds one carries no token.
 *
 * <p><b>Two scopes must not share a subscription.</b> A push subscription is keyed by its argument, and the
 * same statement compiles to different sql under different scopes — so if the token sat outside equality they
 * would compare equal, share one QueryInfo, and the second subscriber would be served rows fetched under the
 * first's scope. Fragmentation is by scope, not by caller: the fixed-set rule on tokens is what bounds it.
 *
 * <p><b>A client cannot supply one.</b> The field is transient and the serial codec names every field it
 * encodes, so it is off the wire by construction rather than by a refusal someone has to remember to write.
