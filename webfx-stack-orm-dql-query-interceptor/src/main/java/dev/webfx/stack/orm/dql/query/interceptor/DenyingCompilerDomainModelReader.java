/**
 * The compiler's view of the domain model, with the client-secret tables and columns removed from it.
 *
 * <p>This is where the check can be exhaustive rather than hopeful. The compiler states, in its own interface,
 * that every time it needs the domain model it asks this reader — and every table name in the SQL it emits
 * (FROM, every join, common-table entities, parameter references) and every column (selected, filtered, sorted,
 * joined on, or reached through a dot path from some unrelated root) is obtained from one of three methods here.
 * So a query that touches a denied column cannot be compiled through this reader at all, however it is phrased,
 * and nothing had to predict the phrasing. A traversal of the parsed statement, by contrast, would be only as
 * complete as its author's memory of every construct the grammar allows.
 *
 * <p>Only the methods that put a NAME into the SQL are checked. The other two tell the compiler how to navigate
 * — which class a foreign key points at, which fields to load by default — and emit nothing on their own; any
 * column they lead to is still named through a checked method.
