/**
 * Round-trips a principal through mint and verify, and checks what the token carries beside it.
 *
 * <p>Two of these once failed: a principal minted with Integer ids came back with Byte ids and did not
 * equals() itself. They pass because the principal was given value equality, NOT because the check was
 * relaxed to accommodate it. Keep it that way — the "same person and account" case is the one that
 * detects a principal type whose equality is by object identity, and such a type breaks the authorization
 * cache and the login-transition check without ever failing.
 *
 * <p>The session-bookkeeping cases are the ones that keep the payload wire-compatible in both directions.
 * If a codec ever started reading a {@code $}-prefixed key, or the session fields stopped being siblings
 * of the principal's own, a deploy would sign out everyone whose token was minted by the other half of a
 * blue/green pair — silently, because both halves would still verify the signature.
 *
 * <p>The principal here is {@link CheckPrincipal}, not an application's: this module must build without
 * the application above it. That Modality's own principals survive this round trip — the guest, and the
 * support view whose restriction must not be lost — is checked by ModalityPrincipalTokenCheck, in
 * modality-crm-server-authsession-plugin, where depending on both sides is legal.
 *
 * <p>No test framework, for the reason recorded in webfx-stack-authz-core: this repository declares no
 * JUnit. Run from main(); it exits non-zero while the issue stands.
