/**
 * Where a session family's generation counter lives, so that a retired token can be recognised.
 *
 * <h3>Why a counter and not the tokens</h3>
 *
 * <p>Keeping issued or retired tokens grows without bound and puts credential-shaped material at rest
 * for no gain. A family gets a counter instead: the signed payload carries {@code (familyId, generation)},
 * renewal increments it, and on presentation {@code generation == current} is fine, {@code generation <
 * current} means a retired token is in somebody's hands, and {@code generation > current} cannot happen
 * without forging the MAC. One row per active session, nothing secret in it, bounded by concurrent
 * sessions rather than by renewals over time.
 *
 * <p>This is what converts a stolen token from an undetectable capability into a detectable event — the
 * highest-value thing on this whole piece of work that is not the identity flip itself, because it is a
 * compromise signal that today does not exist in any form.
 *
 * <h3>Two rules an implementation must not get wrong</h3>
 *
 * <p><b>An unreadable row is not a verdict.</b> If the database does not answer, fail the returned
 * future. Do NOT return a verdict that ends the session: treating "the database did not answer" as
 * "this token is retired" would turn a database blip into a mass logout, which is the same error as
 * recovering a failed identity check into a logged-out user, and a table on the authentication path is
 * exactly where that comes back.
 *
 * <p><b>The increment must be atomic against the live row.</b> Two instances share nothing but the
 * database during a blue/green deploy, and two browser tabs share one token. A read-then-write, or a
 * write whose condition is evaluated against a snapshot, lets both renewals succeed and leaves one
 * client holding a generation the other has retired — a suspected theft that is really a second tab.
