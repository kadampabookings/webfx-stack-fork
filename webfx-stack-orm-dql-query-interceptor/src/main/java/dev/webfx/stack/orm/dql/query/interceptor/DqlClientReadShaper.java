/**
 * Describes one client read: what it is rooted at, what it reaches, and what its WHERE ties down.
 *
 * <p>Step 0 of the read-authorization plan. It answers questions of FACT and none of judgement — whether the
 * facts add up to a query scoped to its caller is the application's to decide, because only the application
 * knows what an ownership predicate is called in this domain.
 *
 * <h3>Why this never decides anything</h3>
 *
 * <p>It is driven from {@link DqlClientQueryInspector} on a pass of its own, after the verdict and separately
 * from it, and it swallows everything it cannot read. A description that could fail a query would make turning
 * observation on a change of behaviour, which is the one thing step 0 must not be.
 *
 * <h3>What "bound" means here: intersection of rows versus union of rows</h3>
 *
 * <p>Everything below reports what a statement GUARANTEES about the rows it can return, never what it merely
 * mentions. One rule generates the rest, and it is the only one worth remembering: <b>a conjunction narrows the
 * rows, an alternative widens them</b>, so
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>AND is satisfied by ANY side.</b> {@code A and B} matches at most the rows {@code A} alone would, so
 *       one binding conjunct binds the whole of it.</li>
 *   <li><b>OR and UNION need EVERY side.</b> {@code A or B} matches the rows of both, so it guarantees something
 *       only if both sides do. {@code id = $1 or true} guarantees nothing; {@code id = $1 or parent = $1}
 *       guarantees plenty, and reporting THAT as unconstrained is the mistake this paragraph exists to prevent.
 *       A union is the same operation spelled differently, and is treated identically.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Bounded is a property of the statement; a bound FIELD is a property shared by every alternative.</b>
 * The two come apart, which is why they are reported separately. The front office expands
 * {@code accountCanAccessPersonOrders($1, person)} into a union by hand, because the macro's OR spans two person
 * rows and defeats every index: one branch binds {@code person.frontendAccount}, the other
 * {@code person.accountPerson.frontendAccount}. No single field is bound in both, and the statement is
 * nonetheless scoped to one account. Reporting only the intersection called the orders page unconstrained — and
 * an enforcement rule written from that would have refused the codebase's own documented performance pattern.
 *
 * <p>A guard is a function in CONJUNCT position and must hold on EVERY alternative, for the same reason: an
 * ownership predicate in one branch of an OR leaves the other branch returning whatever it likes. A guard is
 * reported but never treated as constraining the rows, because whether a name means "scoped" cannot be known
 * from here — {@code searchMatchesPerson(p)} sits in the same position as an ownership predicate and scans the
 * table. The application is asked instead, which is the division this module draws everywhere else.
 *
 * <p>What is deliberately NOT read as binding: {@code x in (select …)}. A subquery can select anything, so it
 * bounds nothing this can verify. That leaves such a statement described as unconstrained when in practice it is
 * not — the safe direction, and the one case where the conservative answer is kept on purpose.
